# That Data Guy Python Series

This repository contains scripts and other related files for weeks 4, 5, and 6. Anyone is able to clone the main repository and create their own branches but cannot merge into it.

The aim of this repository is for you take what you learn from Week 4: Data Engineering to Week 5: Data Analysis and then onto Week 6: Machine Learning; with the same set up. I understand that not everyone can use git so I've included a link to how to install git on your local machine as well as a cheat sheet so you are familiar with the different commands.
